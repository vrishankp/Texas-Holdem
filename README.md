# Texas-Holdem
Here is a simulation I made for Texas Holdem. This will display the frequency of winning a game of Texas Holdem with a certain hand ranking (from 1 being Pair to 9 being a Straight Flush). In due time, I will update to be able to simulate more, such as see which hole cards have the highest winning percent.

# v2.0 Update: Probability of Winning
Upon running the program, if you type 2, you can now type the community cards and your hand to caluclate how likely you are to win by counting how many hands your hand beats. This also generates an output.csv file that is the list of all the hands that could beat you at this current time.

# v3.0 Update: Probability of Winning with all players
Upon running the program, if you type 3, you can now type the community cards and the cards of all the players. This allows you to see who is how likely to win. As more community cards are placed, you can add more community cards to see how the odds change and who ends up winning.
